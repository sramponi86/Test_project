Goal was to create a project based on the specified requirements on extensibility, possibility
to play as human versus computer or only computer, and provide coverage, in this case for
unit testing.
Project was setted up with maven to handle dependencies via pom.xml, then three main classes were developed:
GameEngine -> to define the computer move (generateComputerMove) and get the results (determineWinner)
Game -> to initialize the game (start) and allow the modalities selection (playerVsComputer , computerVsComputer)
Player -> as extension classes

Coverage was created via Junit to this different classes. More discussions can be done live eventually.
